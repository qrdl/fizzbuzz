# fizzbuzz

Optimisation of classic [FizzBuzz](http://wiki.c2.com/?FizzBuzzTest) test.

### supernaive
The least efficient implementation, with 3 *if*s and two *printf*s per number. It is so inefficient that I don't even use it for comparison.

### naive
A little bit optimised version, with 2 *if*s (not counting the loop condition) and 1 *printf* per number.

### unrolled
Single loop iteration for 15 numbers, it means for 15 numbers just one branch (vs 45 branches for naive) and 1 *printf* (vs 15 *printf*s for naive).

### customprint
Generic *printf* replaced with custom print routine, tailored for this particular task.

### reusebuf
Reuse buffer from previous iteration, update only the changed characters. Use x86_64 vector instructions for comparing buffers.

### multithreaded
Use worker threads to process the sets of numbers in parallel.

## Comparison

All tests are performed on Dell Latitude 7480 with Core i7-7600U (2 cores with hyperthreading) and 16 Gb RAM, OpenSUSE Leap 15.1, kernel 4.12.14.
Output redirected to /dev/null. Multithreaded implementation uses 4 worker threads, with load of 3M number per thread.
